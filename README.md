<h1>FlavorFinder</h1>
<h2>Code:You Web Development Pathway Capstone Project</h2>
<p>FlavorFinder is a web application that helps users find recipes based on ingredients they already have at home. Using the Spoonacular API, the site allows users to input available ingredients and get recipe suggestions, along with recipe instructions, nutrition information, etc. The web app will also have filtering options for various dietary preferences and restrictions (i.e., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.). The site aims to minimize food waste, encourage home cooking, and simplify meal planning through a responsive, user-friendly interface built with Bootstrap.</p>
